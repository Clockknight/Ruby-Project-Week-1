puts "Please enter the first variable for the multiplying calculator."
#Promt user for variable.
calc_num1 = gets.to_i
#User types in answer, and is stored into a variable, for later.

puts "\nPlease enter the second variable for the multiplying calculator."
calc_num1 *= gets.to_i
#Similar process to above, only different variable used.

print "\n "
print calc_num1
#Print result for user
